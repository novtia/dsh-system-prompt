/**
 * Snapshot cleanup policy: the persisted config file, its validation, the
 * `/snapshot-auto-cleanup` command's argument grammar, and the auto-sweep
 * throttle. Kept free of host wiring so the policy and the parser are
 * unit-testable in isolation; `src/index.ts` is the only consumer.
 *
 * Semantics (the "cleanup" vocabulary deliberately avoids "retention"):
 * - `enabled` toggles the AUTOMATIC (24h) sweep. `false` (the default) keeps
 *   every snapshot — the pre-feature behavior — and never writes a file.
 * - `maxAgeDays` is the only "keep" knob: a finished session dir whose newest
 *   member stamp is older than this many days of idle is removed by a sweep.
 *   `0`/negative/non-integer are rejected, so a broken file can never steer
 *   the sweep into deleting everything.
 * - The config file is created ONLY by an explicit `/snapshot-auto-cleanup`
 *   write. An absent file reads as the safe default (off); an unreadable or
 *   invalid file reports `ok:false` so a sweep fail-closes (deletes nothing)
 *   instead of guessing.
