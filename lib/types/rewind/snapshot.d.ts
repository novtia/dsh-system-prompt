/**
 * Checkpoint store — the Claude Code style file-rewind backing for dsh-rewind.
 *
 * Claude Code's checkpointing (see README) works like this: it creates a
 * BACKUP of a file BEFORE every tracked modification, groups those backups by
 * the user message they belong to (a "checkpoint"), and rewinding to a
 * checkpoint restores every backup recorded at or after it — modified files
 * are written back to their pre-edit content, files created after the target
 * are deleted. This module is the same design, persisted on disk:
 *
 * - `tools/execute` captures the BEFORE state of each tracked write/edit call
 *   (or "created" when the file did not exist) — the capture happens at the
 *   around-dispatch stage, so an approval `ask` short-circuit cannot skip it
 *   and a denied call never records.
 * - The entry is committed to disk at `tools/post-execute` under the turn's
 *   anchor seq: `<root>/<sessionId>/<anchorSeq>/<callId>.json`, carrying the
 *   path and the before content (`before: null` = the file was created).
 * - Because entries live on disk under the dsh data directory, they survive a
 *   host restart, are bounded (the newest 100 anchor groups per session are
 *   kept), and restores read/write the real file system with plain `node:fs`
 *   — independent of the fs service.
 *
 * Security note: this `node:fs` authority is the DSH host authority every host
 * plugin holds — the model-facing fences constrain the model's tools, not this
 * code. The store stays bounded to the model-touched paths, so excluding a
 * file (e.g. `.env`) is a model-permission concern (see `SECURITY.md`).
 *
 * Crash safety (this module's own engineering asset):
 *  - Checkpoint commits are ATOMIC: the entry JSON is written to a sibling
 *    temp file and renamed over the target, so a host crash mid-write can
 *    never leave a readable half-written entry — at worst an inert `.tmp`
 *    leftover that the next commit of the same file overwrites and that no
 *    reader ever picks up.
 *  - Every restore pass is JOURNALED. Before mutating anything the store
 *    captures the pre-restore ("rescue") state of each planned path and
 *    persists an intent journal (`restore-journal-<op>.json` in the session
 *    dir), then marks each action done as it is applied. A crash at any point
 *    leaves the journal on disk; after a host restart
 *    `reconcileRestores(sessionId)` re-derives from the REAL disk which
 *    paths already match the target and which are still pending (reporting
 *    "restored up to where, what changed"), auto-heals journals whose goal is
 *    already reached, and `continueRestore` / `rollbackRestore` finish the
 *    interrupted op or undo it back to the exact pre-restore state.
 *  - Journal IO is best-effort and never fails a restore: if the journal
 *    cannot be written the restore proceeds exactly like the pre-journal code
 *    (crash safety degrades, behavior does not).
 *
 * Restore semantics (identical to Claude Code): for every path with entries
 * anchored at or after the target message, apply the EARLIEST entry — write
 * the before content back, or delete the file when that entry recorded a
 * creation. Symlinked and hard-linked paths are skipped and reported, never
 * written through.

     * dangling. Links form a linear predecessor chain, so materializing the first
     * link after each doomed real is enough — later links already point at that
     * materialized entry (or at other kept links), requiring no rewrite.
     *
     * `opts.crash` is the test-only seam: a crash fired inside a materialization
     * write (between its temp write and rename) leaves ONLY a `.tmp` — the doomed
     * real is still on disk and the kept link still resolves, so nothing dangles
     * and a later prune simply re-materializes.

     *    in-memory entry (e.g. a session whose dir was removed out-of-band) would
     *    otherwise link a later `recordEntry` to a deleted prior entry, leaving a
     *    dangling ref that breaks restore resolution. This is the primary
