/**
 * Pure rewind planning: target resolution and surface-range computation.
 * No I/O and no `Session` dependency — everything derives from the event log
 * and the ordered surface, so this module stays unit-testable.
 *
 * Rewind semantics (see README): rewinding to a user message appends a marker
 * node into the session log whose `surfaceOp` replaces every surface node
 * AFTER the target with itself. The log (the audit trail and the rendered
 * transcript) is untouched; only the model-visible surface is cut, so the
 * next request derives its context from the target message onward.
 *
 * Marker shape (v0.3.4+): the marker is an EMPTY `assistant/message` with a
 * replace `surfaceOp`, wrapped in its own step frame —
 *
 *   step/start (turn, step) → assistant/message (marker) → step/end (turn, step)
 *
 * The step frame exists because the harness token-meter replays the log and
 * requires every `assistant/message` to sit inside an OPEN step whose
 * `(turn, step)` matches exactly (`token meter: assistant/message at seq N
 * has no matching step/start event` otherwise) — a bare marker appended while
 * idle (every step already closed) makes every later measure() call throw,
 * which disables /compact and automatic compaction. The frame's `turn` is the
 * LAST STARTED turn (`markerTurnOf`) and `step` is that turn's next unused
 * step number (`markerStepOf`): never a reused one, or the client
 * conversation assembler sees a duplicate `step/start` and rejects the log
 * with "received more than one start Match". The agent loop numbers its own
 * steps from memory (each new turn restarts at 1), so the ghost step can
 * never collide with a future real step.
 *
